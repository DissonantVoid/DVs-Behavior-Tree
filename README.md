# Dissonant Void's Behavior Tree
A modular behavior tree implementation addon for Godot4, with a user-friendly, extendable system allowing for adaptive AI that reacts to its environment and performs many actions without the code turning spagetti with each iteration.\
With this addon you can make complex NPCs to populate your world, or bosses that can go through multiple phases with the combination of simple actions and flow control.

This addon started as a small project for personal use to implement features I couldn't find in other BT addons (mainly node interruption) but had grew enough to be worth sharing with the community.

## Easy to setup and use
Setup tree structure easily using nodes.

## Modular system
Bahavior trees are highly scalable by design, allowing for iterable design where nodes are added/removed to reach a complex AI one step at a time.

## Customization and fine-tuning
Built-in nodes offer customization whenever possible, and if you need evern more control extend any class and make your own!

## Debugger
A powerful and optimized debugger that allows for viewing active behavior trees, their decision making and data (blackboards) in real-time. It also allows for overriding the flow to help with debugging.
