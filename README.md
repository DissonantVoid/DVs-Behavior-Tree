# Dissonant Void's Behavior Tree
A modular behavior tree implementation addon for Godot 4, with a user-friendly, extendable system allowing for adaptive AI that reacts to its environment and performs many actions without the code turning spagetti with each iteration.\
With this addon you can make complex NPCs to populate your world, or bosses that can go through multiple phases with the combination of simple actions and flow control.

> [!NOTE]
> This addon started as a small project for personal use to implement features I couldn't find in other BT addons (mainly interruption related) but had grew enough to be worth sharing with the community.

## Modular system
Bahavior trees are highly scalable by design, allowing for iterable design where nodes are added, removed and even reused to reach a complex AI one step at a time.
