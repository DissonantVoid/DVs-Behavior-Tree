# Dissonant Void's Behavior Tree
A modular behavior tree implementation addon for Godot4, with a user-friendly and extendable system allowing the creation of adaptive AI able to react to its environment and perform many actions without the code turning more spagetti with each iteration.
With this addon you can make complex NPCs to populate your world, or bosses that can go through many phases and react to multiple conditions with the combination of simple actions and flow control.
