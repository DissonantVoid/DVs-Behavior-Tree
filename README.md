# Dissonant Void's Behavior Tree
A modular behavior tree implementation addon for Godot4, with a user-friendly and extendable system allowing for adaptive AI that reacts to its environment and perform many actions without the code turning spagetti with each iteration.
With this addon you can make complex NPCs to populate your world, or bosses that can go through many phases and react to multiple conditions with the combination of simple actions and flow control.

### modular system
Bahavior trees are highly scalable by design, allowing for iterable design where nodes are added/removed to reach a complex AI one step at a time.

### customization and fine tuning
Designed with customization in mind, ...
(exports (timer min/max, tree...), entending classes)

### debugger
A powerful debugger that allows for viewing active behavior trees, their decision making and their data (blackboards) in real-time. It also allows for overriding the flow to help with debugging.
