A modular and scalable behavior tree implementation addon. Allowing you to create adaptive AI that reacts to its environment. With a user-friendly, extendable system, you can create complex NPCs to populate your world, or bosses that can go through many phases and react to multiple conditions without making spagetti code with the combination of simple actions and flow control.
