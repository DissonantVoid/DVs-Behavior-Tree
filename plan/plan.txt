## Notes ##
-if a node emits an editor warning in _get_configuration_warnings, don't repeat the warning at runtime somewhere else
-avoid asserting, prefer throwing warnings and accounting for errors instead of crashing
-allow user to add non BT nodes under a branch, and just ignore them
-mark major and minor versions with git tags
-nodes should not have any children in local scene since users will be instancing with "add child node" which works similar to attaching the script to an empty node
-color palette: main af9dd9, seconday 4a4563
-icon file name should match scene file name

## Tasks ##
1.4:
[..] documentations
asset lib setup
examples (use my space game as example, ants sim could work too)

unit tests: (see https://github.com/bitwes/Gut)
-all node types and their expected behavior
-blackboard
-conditional aborts
-forcing a path from any node to any other
-pausing/unpausing

other nodes:
-parallel node (runs all children in parallel)
-placeholder leaf (holds desciption of what the branch is going to have)

follow official style guide so it's easier for others to contribute
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#doc-gdscript-styleguide

## Future ##
additional nodes (in their own "extension" folder so we don't bloat the main folder):
-play animation (optional wait for finish)
-play sound (optional wait for finish)
-agent look at (2d/3d) (requires character2d)
-agent go to (2d/3d) (requires nav agent and nav mesh)
-play particles (optional wait for finish)

support for time based tick intervals alongside frame based intervals in trees

ability to modify blackboard values in debugger

nodes grouping in debugger, a branch can have an optional "group" variable that makes the debugger
encapsulate it and and all its children in a colored rectangle

debugger real time node data updates, allowing user to track export variables
-custom nodes made by users should be able to add their custom data too

tree stats in debugger:
-heatmap of the most visited nodes
-benchmarks for whole tree and individual nodes

make into C++ module
translation
multiplayer support (isn't this as simple as the user disabling tree in puppet? need to test)
