# How It Works
# Your First Behavior Tree
# Blackboard

# Debugging Tools
# Best Practices

-jerky movement if action node doesn't return running
-different ways to do things (parallel node vs service, conditional abort vs reactive composite...)
# Custom Nodes
(what to inherite/override, templates etc...)
# Limitations
-await not supported in tick()
